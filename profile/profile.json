  "summary": "I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Western Ontario. After graduation, I spent a year in Austria as a postdoc researcher mainly focusing on designing efficient algorithms for optimization problems. After my postdoc, I realized I was interested in engaging myself in a more practical environment. I am eager to use my strong problem-solving potential and creativity to solve real-life problems. I think a scientific mindset is a great asset that can assist me in writing meaningful programs. During my Ph.D. I worked on a data science-computer vision project called pedestrian detection in which I learned how to extract meaningful features from data for classification. In addition, in my post-doc research project, I learned to work with neural networks. I joined Jarvis Consulting Company as a Data Engineer and I am currently working on Python/SQL data analytics project."
