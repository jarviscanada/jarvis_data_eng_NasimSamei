#Introduction
London gift shop, an online gift retailer has been running online shopping for 10 years, however, their revenue didn't grow recently. The company wants to use advanced analytics techniques to better understand its clients and come up with more effective business strategies. 
However, since LGS IT resources are limited for data analytics. LGS decided to ask Jarvis Consulting Company for assistance. The project is a proof of concept and it uses sample SQL data called retail data provided by LGS for analytics and monitoring the behavior of customers. 
The retail data is loaded into a PSQL DB which could be considered as a Data Warehouse used for data analyses. Next, analyses are performed using python in Jupyter Notebook. Especially, pandas library for storing (using DataFrames) and manipulating data. In addition, Matplotlib is used for plotting. The LGS marketing team uses these analytics results to come up with strategies for attracting more new and existing customers.

#Architecture
London Gift Shop (LGS) web applications are managed by Azure resource groups which consist of two parts of front-end and backend APIs. Frontend files are managed by a content delivery network (CDN). The backend APIs have a microservice architecture built by a cluster of containers. These containers are storing data in a Microsoft SQL server. For OLAP purposes the transactional data from the Microsoft SQL server is loaded into a PSQL database that is separate from the azure environment. Then the Jupyter Notebook is connected to PSQL to perform  analytics.

#Data Analytics and Wrangling
[Here](./retail_data_analytics_wrangling.ipynb) you can find the result of the data analytics. According to Monthly Sales charts, the Sale increased in November however then decreased dramatically in January. In addition, we have a similar situation for the Monthly Active Users chart. The number of active users increased in November; however, later in January, this number decreased remarkably. To increase both sales and the number of active users one suggestion is to have more promotions and sales events in January and February. 
Moreover, if we note the result of RFM segmentation there are a considerable number of customers from groups 'Can't lose' or 'At risk'. We need to develop some marketing strategies like targeted promotions or contacting the customer to decrease the risk of losing valuable customers.
